# jQuery Space Frame

## Development

The javascript source is written in coffeescript.  To compile it you will need
to install node.js, npm, and the coffee-script node package.

after you have node.js and npm installed...

```
npm install coffee-script
bundle install
bundle exec rake watch
```

The assets are now being watched and compiled automatically when you save.
